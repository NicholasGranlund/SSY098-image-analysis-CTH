# SSY098 Image Analysis

This repository contains the Labs 1-4 for the course SSY098 Image Analysis from Chalmers University of Technology. 

**Course year**: 2023

**By**: Nicholas Granlund

## Lab 1: The SIFT Descriptor

- This laboratory session covers the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) descriptor, which is a well-known technique for detecting and describing features in computer vision. SIFT is particularly powerful because it can detect features that are invariant to changes in scale, rotation, and other transformations in images.


## Lab 2: Learning and convolutional neural networks

- This laboratory session covers Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are deep neural networks frequently employed in computer vision and image analysis.

## Lab 3: Image registration

- This laboratory covers the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm, a technique used for image registration, which involves aligning two or more images of the same scene captured from different perspectives or at different times.

## Lab 4: Triangulation and localization

- This laboratory session covers the triangulation algorithm utilized in computer vision, which is a method for estimating the location of a point in 3D space based on its projection onto two or more 2D images. Triangulation is a widely-used process in computer vision for reconstructing 3D scenes from multiple 2D images.
