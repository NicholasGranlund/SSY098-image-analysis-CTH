# SSY098 Image Analysis

This repository contains the Labs 1-4 for the course SSY098 Image Analysis from Chalmers University of Technology. 

**Course year**: 2023

**By**: Nicholas Granlund

## Lab 1: The SIFT Descriptor

- In this laboratory session, the topic of discussion is the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) descriptor. SIFT is a well-known technique used for detecting and describing features in the field of computer vision.


## Lab 2: Learning and convolutional neural networks

- This laboratory session covers Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are deep neural networks frequently employed in computer vision and image analysis.

## Lab 3: Image registration

- This laboratory covers the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm, a technique used for image registration, which involves aligning two or more images of the same scene captured from different perspectives or at different times.

## Lab 4: Triangulation and localization

- This laboratory session covers the triangulation algorithm utilized in computer vision, which is a method for estimating the location of a point in 3D space based on its projection onto two or more 2D images. Triangulation is a widely-used process in computer vision for reconstructing 3D scenes from multiple 2D images.
